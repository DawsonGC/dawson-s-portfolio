    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This project is about designing and building a robot capable of positioning an instrument such as a 3D printer head or measurement device accurately in 3D space. This project was done as part of an engineering computaion course during my degree and recieved an A grade. This project was quite involved and required me to come up with extremely creative solutions due to the extremely limited compute power I had for the project. I learned a lot about computers and also about assembly, 3D printing, and project planning. Since this was a solo project I had to figure everything out on my own which was a nice challenge. Overall, I am extremely happy I was able to complete this complex project with only around 100 dollars and less than 3 months. </p>
