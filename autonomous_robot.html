    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This robot was built as part of an automation and robotics course. The assignment involved assembling a wheeled robot kit and programming it to autonomously navigate its environment. While the physical build was straightforward, the software and control systems required extensive debugging and re-engineering due to outdated documentation and incomplete libraries.</p>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>The original motor driver documentation was incorrect, requiring me to manually map the control pins and match them to functional driver libraries. After verifying motor control, I focused on the ultrasonic sensor and rotating servo. By using a dedicated library and modifying scan behavior, I was able to generate 180° obstacle scans, enabling effective environment sensing.</p>

    <p>The first version of the robot scanned one degree at a time with ~20ms delay per step, which significantly slowed the robot. I optimized the scan loop by refactoring delays and improving control logic, resulting in a fast and reliable obstacle detection system capable of running at full motor speed while avoiding collisions.</p>

    <h2>Functionality</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Autonomous collision avoidance using real-time distance scanning</li>
      <li>Dynamic sweep of ±90° with trigger-based wall detection logic</li>
      <li>Failsafe right-turn maneuver when objects are within 100mm</li>
      <li>Bluetooth integration for manual override using phone-based character commands</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) with servo-mounted sweep</li>
      <li>Motor driver board (manually remapped and configured)</li>
      <li>Custom C++ firmware using Arduino libraries and Bluetooth serial communication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>The robot successfully completed its mission objectives, navigating autonomously and adapting in real-time to new obstacles. The integration of Bluetooth control provided additional functionality and demonstrated mastery of embedded systems, sensor integration, and real-time optimization in robotics.</p>
