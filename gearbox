    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project was a ground-up design of a compact planetary gearbox intended for FDM 3D printing. The goal was to create a fully functional, easy-to-assemble transmission system that could be manufactured in a single print session. The system includes screws and bolts for securing the outer casing, while the carrier uses a press-fit, the gears are designed with clearance fits to ensure smooth motion, and alignment features use a light press-fit for disassembly ease and positional stability.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>I was responsible for all aspects of the gearboxâ€”from gear ratio calculations and CAD modeling to printing, post-processing, and testing. I designed the gear profiles manually in Fusion 360, accounting for printer tolerances and PLA flexibility to ensure a tight but interference-free fit. The result was a fully functional planetary gearbox with smooth rotation and a modular architecture designed for future upgrades.</p>

    <h2>Engineering Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed for a 4:1 reduction ratio using a single-stage planetary configuration</li>
      <li>Custom tolerances tuned for FDM printers to ensure gear meshing without post-machining</li>
      <li>Press-fit pins and modular assembly allowed for simple construction and servicing</li>
      <li>Integrated alignment ribs and notches ensured coaxial integrity</li>
      <li>Outer casing secured with standard machine screws to enable repeatable disassembly</li>
      <li>All components fit within a single 256mm x 256mm build plate for streamlined printing</li>
      <li>This was the third design iteration, refined for better meshing, tolerance control, and modularity</li>
      <li>Utilized a combination of press fits (for the carrier) and clearance fits (for gears) to balance structural retention and smooth motion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The gearbox functioned smoothly under unloaded conditions, with minimal backlash and consistent gear alignment during hand-driven testing. Although no load testing was performed at this stage, the proof-of-concept validates the fitment and movement integrity. Load testing and dynamic trials are planned for future stages once associated mechanical systems are brought online.</p>

    <h2>Tools & Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fusion 360 (gear design, assembly modeling)</li>
      <li>FDM 3D Printer (PLA, 0.4mm nozzle)</li>
      <li>Calipers for tolerance checks</li>
      <li>Custom CAD-based fitment testing</li>
    </ul>
